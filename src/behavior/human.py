"""Human-like interaction primitives.

Behavioral model
----------------
Bot detectors score *how* a page is driven, not just *what* the fingerprint
says. The classic tells are:

* **Instant actions** — ``fill()``/``click()`` with zero delay between
  focus, typing, and submit. Real users focus a field, hesitate, then type
  unevenly.
* **Linear mouse paths** — programmatic ``mouse.move`` traces a perfect
  straight line at constant velocity; human hands move in gentle curves
  with acceleration/deceleration, and routinely *overshoot* a target and
  correct back onto it.
* **Uniform typing cadence** — real keystroke intervals follow a skewed,
  wpm-dependent distribution with occasional long pauses (word boundaries,
  thinking) and rare typo/backspace corrections.
* **Mechanical scrolling** — one big ``window.scrollBy`` jump versus
  several uneven wheel notches with pauses while the user reads.

Each primitive below reproduces one of those irregularities using
:mod:`random` only, is seedable via :func:`new_rng`, and never raises on
best-effort operations (a detector must never be the thing that crashes a
session — failures are swallowed where safe to do so).

The functions operate on a Playwright ``Page`` (as exposed on
``LaunchedProfile.page``); they are synchronous to match the rest of the
codebase's Camoufox ``sync_api`` usage.
